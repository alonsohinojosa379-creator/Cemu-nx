# Nintendo Switch build

The launcher and runtime use the lowercase directory `sdmc:/switch/cemu/`.
Install the final `cemu.nro` as `sdmc:/switch/cemu/cemu.nro`.

## Unified Mesa SDK

Extract the complete Mesa 26.2.0 Switch unified SDK into
`dependencies/switch_mesa_vulkan/`, then verify it with:

```sh
./dist/switch/deps/prepare_nvk.sh --check
```

The private driver payload is ignored by Git. The build localizes its archives
into one link object shared by native Vulkan and Zink, while native NVC0 and
Zink OpenGL are linked from the same SDK. The resulting core contains all three
rendering backends.

## LSFG-VK

LSFG support is built from `third_party/lsfg-vk`. Supply your own compatible
`Lossless.dll` at `sdmc:/switch/cemu/lsfg/Lossless.dll`. Enable LSFG preparation
in **Settings > Frame Generation**, then enable frame generation at runtime from
the in-game quick menu. It always starts disabled for each game.

The vendored LSFG-VK code is GPL-3.0-or-later; see
`third_party/lsfg-vk/LICENSE.md`.

## Build

```sh
BUILD_JOBS=18 ./build_switch_all.sh
```

The finished all-in-one launcher is `switch_launcher/cemu.nro`.

## Launcher updates

The SDL launcher checks the latest published release from
`NaGaa95/Cemu-nx`. Upload the all-in-one launcher as a `.nro` release asset;
`cemu.nro` is preferred when a release contains more than one NRO.

Set `RELEASE_VERSION` to the GitHub tag when making a release:

```sh
RELEASE_VERSION=1.1.4 BUILD_JOBS=18 ./build_switch_all.sh
```

The updater requires GitHub's SHA-256 asset digest and validates both the
digest and NRO structure before replacing the installed launcher.
